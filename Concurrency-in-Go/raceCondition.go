/*
A race condition occurs when multiple threads (goroutines here) are reading and writing to the same variables.

In the example below, we are trying to divide a by b. However, if the divison goroutine occurs before a and b are set, a divide-by-zero exception will occur.
Because the goroutine scheduling mechanism is non-deterministic, we are likely to run into this exception as we iterate through the for loop.
